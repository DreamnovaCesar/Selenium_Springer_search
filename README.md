## Setup

To create a virtual environment with TensorFlow using Anaconda, follow these steps:

Clone github repository in your local system.

```python
git clone https://github.com/DreamnovaCesar/Selenium_Springer_search.git
```

Move in Selenium_Springer_search repository

```python
cd Selenium_Springer_search
```
Open the Anaconda Prompt by clicking the Start button and typing "Anaconda Prompt".
Type the following command to create a new virtual environment called "tfenv" (We used python 3.11):

```python
conda create --name tfenv python=3.11
```
Activate the virtual environment by typing:

```python
conda activate tfenv
```
Finally, install requirements.txt.

```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

when creating the virtual environment, as this algorithm does not plan to be a library at the moment. You will have to use the following CLI code for activation:

```python
python -m app.src.main
```
